# Claude Usage

Prices the Claude Code transcripts on the BB server host and shows what they cost. Ported from the OpenForge `claude-usage` plugin.

## What it adds

- A `Claude usage` page in the sidebar. It shows spend today, over 7 days, over 30 days, and over all indexed history. It also has a 30-day daily chart split by cost component, spend per project, the top 15 threads, and spend per model.
- Today's spend on that sidebar row.
- The spend of the open thread in the thread header.
- A banner that names any model the price table has no rate for.

## How the numbers are produced

Claude Code writes one JSONL transcript per session under `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/`, plus `<session>/subagents/*.jsonl` for subagents. A background service reads both. It re-reads a file only when its size or mtime changed.

Three details decide whether the total is right:

- Claude Code writes one record per content block, and each repeats the response's usage. The scanner keeps one record per `message.id`. Counting records doubles the total.
- The last record for a `message.id` wins. Earlier records of a streamed response carry a partial `output_tokens`.
- Subagent transcripts count. Skipping them loses a double-digit percentage.

Prices live in `PRICE_TABLE` in `src/pricing.ts`, in USD per million tokens. A model id matches its entry exactly after the scanner strips a `[1m]` suffix and a `-YYYYMMDD` date. A prefix match would price `claude-opus-5-5` as `claude-opus-5`. A model with no entry is left out of every figure and named in the banner. Add the entry when Anthropic ships a model or changes a price.

Every figure is a lower bound. The price table reproduces Claude Code's own `cost-state` totals exactly, but the transcripts leave out some billed usage, mostly a few percent of cache reads.

## Storage

The plugin keeps its index in its own SQLite database. Claude Code prunes transcripts after about a month, so the index is the only record of older periods:

- Rows hold token counts per transcript, UTC hour, model, and working directory. Dollars come from the price table on every read, so a corrected rate re-prices all history.
- Re-reading a transcript replaces that transcript's rows only.
- Rows of a deleted transcript stay forever. **Rescan transcripts** merges and never rebuilds.

## Attribution

Spend belongs to a project when its working directory is inside one of the project's source paths or inside one of its environments. The longest matching path wins. Spend that matches nothing shows as "Outside BB".

Spend belongs to a thread only when one Claude Code thread is alone in its environment. In practice that means worktree threads. Threads that share a directory count for their project only, because the transcript cannot say which thread spent the money.

BB clears an environment's path when it destroys the environment. The plugin stores every path it sees, so it keeps attributing after cleanup. For worktrees destroyed before install, it reads the thread id from the folder name (`worktrees/thr_<id>-<n>/`).

Limits:

- Threads on remote hosts write transcripts on that host. The plugin reads only the BB server host.
- If BB renames its worktree folders, the folder-name fallback stops matching. Spend then shows as "Outside BB", never under a wrong thread.

## Setting

`rescanMinutes` (1 to 240, default 5) sets the wait between scans. The service reads it before each wait, so a change applies after the current wait without a reload.

```bash
bb plugin config claude-usage set rescanMinutes 30
```

Set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` on the BB server to read a relocated Claude Code install.

## Development

```bash
npm install --include=dev
npm test && npm run typecheck
bb plugin build
```

Tests use Node's built-in `node:sqlite`, so they run without building the `better-sqlite3` native module.
